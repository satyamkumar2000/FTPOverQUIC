# QUIC-based File Transfer Protocol

This project implements a file transfer protocol over QUIC, supporting both text files and binary files like images.

## Features

- Transfer any type of file, including text and binary files.
- Utilizes QUIC for fast and reliable data transfer.
- Ensures data integrity with checksum verification.

## Requirements

- **Rust**: Ensure Rust is installed on your system.
- The `certs` folder already contains keys and certificates for both client and server generated by me. If you wish to create your own, follow the instructions below.

### Generating Your Own Certificates

1. Ensure **OpenSSL** is installed on your system.

2. Run the `certgen` shell script:
    ```bash
    ./certgen.sh
    ```

3. Make changes in the `certificate.conf` file if needed.

## Usage

1. Build the project (optional, as running the cargo run command directly will also build the project before executing):
    ```bash
    cargo build
    ```

2. Start the server:
    ```bash
    cargo run -- server --cert ./certs/server.crt --key ./certs/server.key
    ```

3. Run the client:
    ```bash
    cargo run --bin quicrs -- client --address 127.0.0.1 --port 54321 --cert ./certs/ca.cert
    ```

Make sure to run these commands in the root folder where the `Cargo.toml` file is located.

## How It Works

1. The server listens for incoming connections and handles file transfer requests.
2. The client connects to the server, sends a file, and receives it back to ensure the transfer was successful.
3. The file transfer includes a checksum verification to ensure data integrity.
