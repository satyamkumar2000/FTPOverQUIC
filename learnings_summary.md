## Learnings after Implementing the Code

- **Handling Multiple Clients**:
  - The implementation now uses asynchronous tasks to handle multiple clients efficiently by creating a new task for each accepted connection. This aspect was not considered in the Part 2 analysis.

- **Checksum Verification**:
  - Detailed implementation of checksum verification ensures file integrity during transfer. This was only briefly mentioned in the Part 2 analysis and lacked implementation details.

- **Logging and Debugging**:
  - The implementation includes logging and debugging statements to trace the process flow and identify issues promptly. Logging was not considered in the Part 2 analysis.

- **Improved Certificate Handling**:
  - Clear instructions and mechanisms for generating and handling TLS certificates for secure communication, which were not detailed in the Part 2 analysis.

- **Client and Server Operation Separation**:
  - The implementation clearly separates client and server operations, providing distinct instructions and functionalities for each. This separation was not detailed in the Part 2 analysis.

- **User-friendly File Selection and Handling**:
  - The client prompts the user for the filename, ensuring ease of use and ensuring the file exists in the root directory. This approach was not considered in the Part 2 analysis.
